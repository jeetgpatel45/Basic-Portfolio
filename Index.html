                    Since you guys already seen my name in the header, let's talk about something else. I moved from <strong><em> INDIA </em></strong> in 2010 and at first I was having a hard time adjusting into new culture and new school system, <br> 
                    but as the time goes through I got comfortable. After I graduated from high school I started college and that did not go well. Because I did not like to take classes that is not required in the real world, so I decided to dropout and started focusing on my hobby.                         On a fun side I like to play games, go for a long road trip with friends or family, explore myslef, and try learning new skills.<br> 
                    That was litlle bit about myself, now let's talk about my hobby <strong><em> ART </em></strong>. From the childhood I have always doing some drawings, but not often. In high school I took only one class, after that I started practicing by myself and got better and better everday.
                    Most of the time I only focus on realism and some of my drawings took me DAYS to complete. Because I feel tired after sometime or I need something that is little bit different, I try to go for a walk or play games. <br>
                    <strong> In my portfolio tab there are some of my pictures that I did when I had nothing to do. </strong><br>
